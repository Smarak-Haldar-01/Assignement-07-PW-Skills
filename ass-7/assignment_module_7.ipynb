    "\n",
    "A:  Compiled Languages completes the steps of checking syntax and machice code translation in one go where as Interpreted languages do the same \n",
    "    in two different steps first the compiler converts the source code into byte code (an intermediate code understable by the interpreter) and then the interpreter translate the byte code into machine-understanding code and then the OS (Windows, Linux, Mac etc.) runs the program.\n",

    "   ii. unknown exceptions that may occur while the process or thread (the program) is running --> in this situation where we are unknown that \n",
    "    which exception may occur (how or when) in the running state of the process, then we should use the Exception class to handel those unknown exceptions. This is done by declaring the parent class of every exception class/method the Exception class in the except statement.\n",
